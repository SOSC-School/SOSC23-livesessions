    "Multiple containers can be *spawned* from the same image, and *all* containers are spawned by an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, once the container is created and running it may evolve to a state which is different from the one defined in the image.\n",

    "However, every new container spawned from the original image will not contain the library you have added.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in the cloud infrastructure, we tend to restart and possibly recreate the containers quite often. This destroy the internal state of the container and restores the original filesystem as defined in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, the filesystem and the data in a container are said to be **ephemeral**. If some data has to be made persistent to the lifecycle of a container, that must be stored **outside** of the container, as we will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker images can be downloaded from remote registries, such as [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com), [INFN harbor](https://harbor.cloud.infn.it) or even [GitLab](https://baltig.infn.it), if you are brave enough. Downloading an image is called to \"pull\" an image.\n"
